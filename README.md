ðŸ“Œ To-Do List App
This is a simple and lightweight To-Do List application built with React.
It allows you to easily add, update, and delete tasks â€” helping you stay organized and productive.

âœ¨ Features
âœ… Add Tasks: Create new tasks with a description and a due date.

âœ…Update Tasks: Edit existing tasks to keep your list up-to-date.

âœ… Delete Tasks: Remove tasks that you no longer need.

âœ… Track Deadlines: Each task includes a due date to help manage your time.

ðŸš€ How it works
Tasks are managed in React state.

Adding a task generates a unique ID and saves it with a default isCompleted status.

Updating or deleting tasks uses simple, clean array operations.

Everything happens instantly on the page â€” no backend needed!
